React on the keywords you visitors are entering into search engines before coming to your site.

== Description ==

Search Engine Keywords (SEK) gives you the opportunity to react on the keywords your visitors entered into a search
engine before coming to your site. The possibilities are amazing, just a few examples:

* write keyword specific greating messages
* offer visitors other internal sites
* scroll to content on longer pages
* prefill contact forms

The plugin currently consists of the logic and a backend to enter patterns for searches.
You still need to develop the reaction on the keywords yourself. A UI will be provided in the future.
